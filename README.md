# Improving Claims Processing Speed 

Brief Summary:

The premise is that a fictional company is taking up too much time in processing their claims and would like to identify how to speed up the process if possible. The question is raised by the legal team in charge of processing claims. Therefore the information presented and any recommendations need to be tailored in such a manner where it makes sense (and is within the means) of the legal team.
